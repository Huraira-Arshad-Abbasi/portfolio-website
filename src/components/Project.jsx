                A full-stack todo management app with user authentication. Each
                user can securely add, view, edit, and delete their own todos.
                Integrated React Router for dynamic routing and Axios for
                client-server communication. Todos are filtered by user email
                and fetched from MongoDB via RESTful API endpoints. Currently
                source code is available on GitHub and will be deployed live
                soon.

                MediaHub is a modern frontend project where users can search, explore, and download high-quality images and videos. Built using React and Vite, this app integrates with the Unsplash and Pexels APIs to fetch media content dynamically. It features a responsive layout, hover controls on videos, and a clean 3-column grid for media display. A search feature allows users to filter results by keyword and type. Currently hosted on GitHub and optimized for future deployment on Vercel.

                Created several frontend clones of websites as part of
                self-learning and UI development practice. These projects helped
                strengthen my skills in layout design, responsiveness, and
                understanding modern web structure. Though not yet uploaded to
                GitHub, they reflect hands-on experience with real-world UI
                patterns and component-based design.
